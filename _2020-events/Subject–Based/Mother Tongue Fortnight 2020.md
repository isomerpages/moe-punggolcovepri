During the annual Mother Tongue Language Fortnight, teachers conducted cultural lessons on Performing Arts as well as language lessons such as Poetry recitation, storytelling and singing.

Students learnt about the unique elements of various Performing Arts such as Chinese Puppetry, Chinese Opera, Wayang Kulit, Boria, Indian Folk dance etc. They completed a quiz after the sharing from their teachers and created artwork after they learnt about Wayang Kulit and Chinese Puppetry.

Students were able to follow the movement/action when they learn about Dikir Barat and Indian folk dance-Oyilattam which means dance of grace.  They also learnt other traditional Performing Arts such as Kompang and Angklung.

Students had a fun and enriching MTL Fortnight, learning unique cultural elements from the 3 races.

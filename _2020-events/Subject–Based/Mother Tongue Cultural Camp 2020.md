The theme for this year’s MTL Cultural Day is on Performing Arts (Puppetry).

Puppetry is a form of theatre or performance that involves puppets that are animated by a human called a puppeteer. There are different types of puppets around the world, such as string puppets, shadow puppets, rod puppets and glove puppets.

Students taking Chinese Language are introduced to glove puppetry for this year’s MTL Cultural Day. Glove puppetry is a type of opera using cloth puppets that originated during the 17th century in Quanzhou of Fujian province in China.

Students learnt about the main characters in glove puppetry, namely _dui zhang_, _sheng_ and _dan_. After teachers explained how glove puppets are crafted and executed, students watched a video to deepen their understanding.

Students were also briefly exposed to other puppet shows from Southeast Asia.

Before the lesson concluded, students get to design their own puppet on a postcard, and are encouraged to share their craft with their family.

Students taking Tamil Language learnt about the different Indian musical instruments.  PowerPoint slides were shown to identify the different Indian musical instruments.  Students also learnt when and how these musical instruments should be used and played.  After that, students did a colouring activity.  They coloured the Tabla and Sitar and described what they like about the instruments.

The Malay Language teachers planned an interesting activity for their students.  It is an extension of the MT Fortnight activity which was carried out earlier in Term 3.  Students were taught to do the traditional head gear which is the Tanjak.  The students had a fun and enriching experience in making the tanjak. They were also exposed to the history and significance of the tanjak.

The theme for Total Defence Day 2020 was “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”. 

For this year, students learn about the six pillars of Total Defence. In addition, students learnt about the importance of working together in unity, as a Singaporean citizen and resident, to defend Singapore.

*   Primary One students focused on Civil Defence and learnt about the importance of preparing a Ready Bag. They were also taught on how to pack for a Ready Bag in case of an emergency.  
      
    
*   Primary Two students focused on Military Defence which included the role of National Service, evolving around the elements of “care” and “resilience”.  
      
    
*   Primary Three students learnt how they can contribute and strengthen Social Defence so that Singaporeans and residents may live together harmoniously.  
      
    
*   Primary Four students discussed how Psychological Defence is crucial to the unity of Singapore.  
      
    
*   Primary Five students learnt that Digital Defence is a whole-of-nation effort to protect and defend ourselves and our nation online.

Our students also learnt the Wipe Down Routine, and played their part maintaining their personal hygiene and upholding their social responsibilities, by cleaning up after themselves to keep the school environment clean.

Although our students may be young, they understood their roles and responsibilities in keeping Singapore strong. They have certainly played their part in the nation’s efforts against the COVID-19 outbreak.

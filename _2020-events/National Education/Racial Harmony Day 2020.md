The school commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 17 July 2020. The theme for Racial Harmony Day 2020 was “Multicultural Singapore”. Students from Primary One to Five participated in class discussions and quizzes that enabled them to understand the culture of other races to maintain a harmonious relationship with one another.
* The Primary 1 and 2 pupils learnt more about the different cultures in Singapore through class discussions. The P2 pupils also shared the common experience of learning and playing traditional games.
* The Primary 3 pupils were engaged in class discussions that aimed to educate them to be respectful when communicating with people. They understood that it was important to get along well with other races as it promotes harmony and strengthens friendships among us.
* The Primary 4 pupils were given the role of being ambassadors of racial harmony. They brainstormed and wrote down notes on how they can promote racial harmony at home, in school and in the neighbourhood.  
* The Primary 5 pupils were given opportunities to share how they could play a part to promote harmony amongst their friends of different ethnic communities.

Our students certainly enjoyed learning about people of different races and to be more tolerant towards one another!

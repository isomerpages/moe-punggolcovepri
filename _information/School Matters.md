<h3>School Matters</h3>
<h4>1) Visitors to School&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Parents who wish to speak or see any staff member of the school will need
to call the General Office to make prior arrangement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the safety of our students and staff, parents who wished to enter
the school would need to register at the security guard post through the
front gate. Please bring along your physical NRIC or equivalent form of
identification document such as driving license, work permit or passport
to facilitate the verification of your identity. A visitor sticker/pass
will be issued to you. After this, please proceed to the General Office.</p>
<h4><strong>&nbsp;</strong>2) Absence from School</h4>
<p>Absence from school must be supported by a medical certificate or a letter
from the parent/guardian and it must be given to the Form Teacher when
the student returns to school. The school will accept up to a maximum of
five letters per semester from parents/guardians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Absence from examination needs to be supported with a medical certificate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please inform the Form Teacher via telephone/email if your child/ward
is going to be absent for more than 1 day of school.</p>
<h4>3) Leaving School During School Hours</h4>
<p>Students are not allowed to leave the school during school hours unless
a parent or an authorised adult comes personally to take him/her home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Parents/guardians who wish to take their child/ward home during
school hours has to sign the child out at the General Office.</p>
<h4>4) Taking Child Out of School during Term Time</h4>
<p>Parents/guardians are advised <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> to take your child/ward
out of school for vacation before the stipulated school holidays as this
will cause disruption to your child’s/ward’s learning. For further clarification,
please email the school at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">punggolcove_ps@moe.edu.sg</a>.</p>
<h4>5) Photography and Videography</h4>
<p>We would also like to inform you that throughout the course of the year,
photograph(s) or video image(s) of you and your child may be captured at
all school events. We may use and publish such photographs and/or video
recordings in school publications, website, social media channels, and

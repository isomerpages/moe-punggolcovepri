The school celebrated Chinese New Year on 15th February 2018. Prior to that, students learnt to sing Chinese New Year songs during music lessons and decorated the classrooms in preparation for the celebration. 

This year marks the maiden collaboration of Punggol Cove Primary School with MOE Kindergarten whereby selected Primary 3 pupils displayed school values of mindfulness and care, leading the kindergarteners in making a Chinese New Year Greeting Card with an origami dog to show appreciation for their loved ones.

On the day of celebration, pupils learnt about Chinese New Year tradition and expressed appreciation for their family by making a greeting card during the classroom activity.

In the hall, pupils awed in amusement as the performers displayed complex dance moves as part of a Chinese Dance performance with silk fan. Pupils were also invited on stage to participate in interactive activities using the props (‘Big Headed Doll’) to add to the festive atmosphere. The simple and meaningful celebration, exposing pupils to Chinese culture, ended on a high note with mass singing and dancing.

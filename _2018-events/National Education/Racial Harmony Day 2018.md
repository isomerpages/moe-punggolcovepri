As we commemorated Racial Harmony Day this year, our students were reminded that the peace and stability that we have today is a result of a conscious effort to practice Mindfulness, Empathy and Care in how we relate to others. The event was celebrated with a strong emphasis on fostering the values of mutual respect, tolerance and acceptance in our students towards their friends of different cultural contexts. These were carried out through carefully planned activities such as learning packages for the primary one to three students, activities that focuses on the theme of cultural awareness for the primary three students, and a Racial Harmony tour for the Primary one and two students where they learnt about our vibrant cultural landscape. 

  

At the end of the day, we were heartened to know that our pupils had acquired the knowledge of  how best to understand and relate more harmoniously with friends from different races.

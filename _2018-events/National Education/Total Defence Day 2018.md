The theme for Total Defence Day 2018 was “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”. 

  

Apart from learning about the five pillars of Total Defence, students also learnt the importance of working together in unity, as a Singaporean citizen and resident, to defend Singapore. Although they may be young, students understood how they can help to keep Singapore strong by playing their part for the country.  

  

Primary One students focused on Civil Defence and learnt about the importance of a Ready Bag. They were also taught on how to pack for a Ready Bag in case of an emergency. Primary Two pupils focused on Military Defence which included the role of National Service, evolving around the elements of ‘care’ and ‘resilience’. Primary Three studentslearnt how they can contribute and strengthen the Social Defence aspect of the Total Defence so that Singaporeans and residents may live together harmoniously. 

  

Additionally, the fire-drill experience held on 1 March 2018 demonstrated the importance of taking care of one another in time of crisis. Students are aware of the importance in remaining calm and to follow instructions clearly. Evacuation to the school field was done quickly and orderly. Kudos to the teachers and students!

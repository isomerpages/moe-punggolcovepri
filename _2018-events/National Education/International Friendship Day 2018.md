This year, in tandem with the theme on ‘Celebrating the Asean Community’, the CCE department celebrated International Friendship Day by focusing on how best we can nurture in our students the cultural awareness about our ASEAN neighbours. We hold on to the belief that in order to maintain harmonious relations with our ASEAN community, it is important for students to learn about the different backgrounds and unique attributes of the people in our neighbouring countries.

  

The department also believes that a focus on three key areas, such as the Head, Heart and Hand would help develop the cultural awareness that we want to nurture in our pupils. Hence, classroom activities were designed to enable our students to learn more about their neighbours, such as the unique environment that we share, the common past with foreign powers that we had, some similar industries that we share, as well as the cultural practices of the people within the ASEAN countries. 

  

On the whole, the knowledge that students acquired went beyond simply knowing what the countries are. Through our tangible lens, we can see that our students displayed greater readiness to care and empathize with their neighbours from the ASEAN community.

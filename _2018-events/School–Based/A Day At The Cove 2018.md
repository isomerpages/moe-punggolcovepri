A Day at the Cove is a yearly event held for the parents of our newly enrolled primary one students. Children invite their parents to school to join them in a day of learning and fun. Parents start the day by attending a curriculum briefing in the hall, after which they make their way to their child’s classroom where they are greeted by a choral reading performance put up by their children for them. The day culminates with a break at recess where parents observe their child play, eat and interact with their peers at school.

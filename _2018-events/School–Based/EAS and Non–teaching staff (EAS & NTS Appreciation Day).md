Executive & Administrative Staff and Non-Teaching Staff (EAS and NTS) in our school community are unsung heroes that tirelessly support us in myriad of ways. Hence, each year, a period of time is set aside to remind students of PCPS to demonstrate our school core values such as mindfulness and care towards them. Students are encouraged to appreciate and show gratitude to them for their support and help rendered.

EAS and NTS staff including operations support officers, school attendants, security officers and dental therapists are personnel that provide vital support in our school in ways that should not be taken for granted. This year, in early October, time was set aside for every pupil to be involved. They were tasked to write appreciative notes and these were combined as a class to be presented to an assigned EAS/NTS personnel. The student councillors went around the school to give these personalised notes to each EAS/NTS personnel.

Besides this, a PPT slideshow was played during assembly and at all recesses during the period of time. This served to create greater awareness among pupils; helping them to identify this special group of people and to understand their scope of work within the school community. The school is a big community that requires many people to work together and the EAS/NTS personnel played important roles in enabling.

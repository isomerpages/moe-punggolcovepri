This year, National Day was celebrated with lots of singing, activities and love! Prior to the celebration, students were taught some of the past year’s national day theme songs and this year theme song during their curriculum time. Besides all the fun-filled activities they had, video on Recollection were played daily to help our children understand the significance of celebrating the National Day yearly. 

  

The highlight of this year’s National Day Observance Ceremony was having our Scouts and teachers running the flag-raising ceremony. Everyone was in awe during this magnificent moment as we sing the national anthem and reciting of the national pledge with pride. Another milestone we achieved this year was having the MOE-Kindergarten joining us in the celebration. As one Punggol Cove family, we sang and celebrated our nation’s birthday together. Children was seen enjoying themselves during the story-telling session. Just like this year’s National Day theme “We are Singapore”, we will work in unity to build a better future for our generation.

<p>The Primary 1 Orientation was held on 28 December 2018. During this day,
the school warmly welcomed our 2019 Primary 1 students to the school with
the company of parents and teachers. The parents were briefed of the school’s
first day matters and they were provided with useful tips and guidelines
to support the well-being of the students. Primary students were introduced
to their teachers and classrooms. They spent some time to get to know their
teachers, classmates and the school during their interaction time in the
classrooms.</p>

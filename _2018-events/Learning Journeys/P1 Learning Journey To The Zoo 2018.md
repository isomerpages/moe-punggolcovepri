Prior to their learning journey, each class was involved in a mini-research project which required them to search for information on a particular endangered species. They also generated questions in reference to the species, hoping to have them answered on their visit to the zoo. 

Post-visit, each class consolidated their learning by participating in a class writing activity which required them to put the pieces of information together for their peers from other classes to read and learn from.

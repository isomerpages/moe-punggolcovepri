<p><strong>Pupil Well Being Programme: Learn through Play</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Learn through Play</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Learn through Play</em>&nbsp;provides a platform for pupils to learn
and practise values and social skills which are essential for them in life.
Albert Bandura (1977) said in his social learning theory that behavior
is learned from the environment through the process of observational learning.
Therefore, we believe the importance of role modelling and hence, our teachers
use teachable moments during recess time to instill the right values and
social skills in our pupils. In addition, restorative approach is used
to help pupils to reflect and adopt a more desirable actions to solve the
problems they face. Through these approaches, pupils develop competencies
like self-awareness, social awareness, self-management and relationship
management skills.&nbsp; Observation made during recess play will also
be reinforced during Assembly and Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP).
At the end of the day, we want to build a culture of care in Punggol Cove
Primary School.</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action Objectives</strong>
<br>We believe that&nbsp;Values in Action (VIA) programmes are good learning
platform that support pupils’ development in the following areas:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Socially responsible citizens who contribute
meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of
values, knowledge and skills. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fosters pupil ownership
over how they contribute to the community. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow
the pupils to reflect on their experience, the values they have put into
practice,&nbsp; and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully</p>

<p><strong>Cleanliness @ PCPS</strong>
</p>
<p>Former Education Minister Ng Chee Meng reiterated the importance of children
participating in cleaning activities in school and home as they are good
avenues for children to develop their social responsibility. &nbsp;He mentioned:
“Over some period of time, I’m sure our kids will learn to take care of
themselves, learn self-reliance and be able to not just do these good things
in school, but be able to go out in society (and show) some graciousness.”
Indeed, this is what we desire to achieve in our Cleanliness Programmes
as well.&nbsp; Cleanliness @ PCPS is one of the Values in Action programmes
introduced in Punggol Cove Primary School. Pupils were taught the reasons
why keeping their environment clean is important. In addition, they were
given the opportunities to carry out the hand-on activity in the classroom.
Many were elated to see themselves accomplished the tasks and was looking
forward to doing it again in the near future.</p>

</div>
<p>To encourage the pupils to continue with these good habits they have learnt
from the school, Cleanliness @ Home project was introduced to inculcate
in our pupils the value of responsibility to self and family. In this project,
pupils are given a task booklet with the list of chores to do. As Psychologist
Albert Bandura mentioned in his self-efficacy theory that when one developed
the belief that they have the ability to accomplish certain tasks they
will in turn feel more confident about themselves. Hence, by helping out
at home, they will become more independent and responsible as a result.</p>

<p><strong>Kindness Week</strong>&nbsp;Plato once said: “Kindness is more
than deeds. It is an attitude, an expression, a look, a touch. It is anything
that lifts another person.” Indeed, it is important to teach our pupils
the importance and the value of kindness from young. Punggol Cove Primary
School believes every pupils can and will be able to demonstrate kindness,
care, empathy and mindfulness towards their friends and love ones. Our
school has also partner with the Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) and
South East Community Development Council to encourage our pupils to express
their kindness to the community through a walk for rice charitable event.
Our school managed to walk a total mileage of 235.2 km and raised a total
of 1,176 bowls of white rice and 1,176 bowls of brown rice, estimated to
benefit around 38 needy families in South East District. This is our way
to teach our pupils that even as young as they are, they are capable to
make a significant difference in the lives of others. In recognizing the
pupils’ effort towards building the culture of care and kindness, we were
awarded as the Friend of Singa in 2016.</p>

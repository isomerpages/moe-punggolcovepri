<p><strong>Pupil Well Being Programme: Learn through Play</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Learn through Play</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Learn through Play</em>&nbsp;provides a platform for pupils to learn
and practise values and social skills which are essential for them in life.
Albert Bandura (1977) said in his social learning theory that behavior
is learned from the environment through the process of observational learning.
Therefore, we believe the importance of role modelling and hence, our teachers
use teachable moments during recess time to instill the right values and
social skills in our pupils. In addition, restorative approach is used
to help pupils to reflect and adopt a more desirable actions to solve the
problems they face. Through these approaches, pupils develop competencies
like self-awareness, social awareness, self-management and relationship
management skills.&nbsp; Observation made during recess play will also
be reinforced during Assembly and Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP).
At the end of the day, we want to build a culture of care in Punggol Cove
Primary School.</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action Objectives</strong>
<br>We believe that&nbsp;Values in Action (VIA) programmes are good learning
platform that support pupils’ development in the following areas:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Socially responsible citizens who contribute
meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of
values, knowledge and skills. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fosters pupil ownership
over how they contribute to the community. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow
the pupils to reflect on their experience, the values they have put into
practice,&nbsp; and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully</p>

<p><strong>Cleanliness @ PCPS</strong>
</p>
<p>Former Education Minister Ng Chee Meng reiterated the importance of children
participating in cleaning activities in school and home as they are good
avenues for children to develop their social responsibility. &nbsp;He mentioned:
“Over some period of time, I’m sure our kids will learn to take care of
themselves, learn self-reliance and be able to not just do these good things
in school, but be able to go out in society (and show) some graciousness.”
Indeed, this is what we desire to achieve in our Cleanliness Programmes
as well.&nbsp; Cleanliness @ PCPS is one of the Values in Action programmes
introduced in Punggol Cove Primary School. Pupils were taught the reasons
why keeping their environment clean is important. In addition, they were
given the opportunities to carry out the hand-on activity in the classroom.
Many were elated to see themselves accomplished the tasks and was looking
forward to doing it again in the near future.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:65%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/cce2.png">
</div>
<p>To encourage the pupils to continue with these good habits they have learnt
from the school, Cleanliness @ Home project was introduced to inculcate
in our pupils the value of responsibility to self and family. In this project,
pupils are given a task booklet with the list of chores to do. As Psychologist
Albert Bandura mentioned in his self-efficacy theory that when one developed
the belief that they have the ability to accomplish certain tasks they
will in turn feel more confident about themselves. Hence, by helping out
at home, they will become more independent and responsible as a result.</p>

<p><strong>Kindness Week</strong>&nbsp;Plato once said: “Kindness is more
than deeds. It is an attitude, an expression, a look, a touch. It is anything
that lifts another person.” Indeed, it is important to teach our pupils
the importance and the value of kindness from young. Punggol Cove Primary
School believes every pupils can and will be able to demonstrate kindness,
care, empathy and mindfulness towards their friends and love ones. Our
school has also partner with the Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) and
South East Community Development Council to encourage our pupils to express
their kindness to the community through a walk for rice charitable event.
Our school managed to walk a total mileage of 235.2 km and raised a total
of 1,176 bowls of white rice and 1,176 bowls of brown rice, estimated to
benefit around 38 needy families in South East District. This is our way
to teach our pupils that even as young as they are, they are capable to
make a significant difference in the lives of others. In recognizing the
pupils’ effort towards building the culture of care and kindness, we were
awarded as the Friend of Singa in 2016.</p>

<h3>Sexuality Education</h3>
<h5><u>MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS</u></h5>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships with others, including
those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the
family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Goals of Sexuality Education are:
<br>(a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.
<br>(b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.
<br>(c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family</p>
<p>as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Key Messages of Sexuality Education are:
<br>(a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;
<br>(b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are
the foundation for strong families);
<br>(c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and
<br>(d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<h5><u>Overview of Punggol Cove Primary School’s <br>Sexuality Education Programme for 2024</u></h5>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through the school
curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped into five main
themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health,
Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for
more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:
<br>(a) Science
<br>(b) Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5><u>Sexuality Education Lessons:</u></h5>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition
and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age
and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes
in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically
ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding
cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore,
our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger
health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students require
close guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual
messages in the media and other sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at
Primary 5 and 6. Through these lessons, students will learn healthy ways
to manage the physiological, social and emotional changes in their growing
years. They learn to build healthy and rewarding relationships with others,
including those with members of the opposite sex. Students are also guided
to make wise, informed and responsible decisions to keep themselves safe
from sexuality-related risks.</p>
</li>

CCA IN GENERAL
--------------

  

*   Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) is a non-academic activity that all students must undertake as part of their education outside of official school hours. 
*   They are only introduced from Primary 3 onwards and is optional, not compulsory. 
*   These activities are crucial as they offer supplementary opportunities for your child to explore their interests or develop them into hobbies like art or dance. 
*   It is a key component of students’ holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents. 
*   Students develop their character, learn values, social emotional competencies and skills to prepare them for future challenges.

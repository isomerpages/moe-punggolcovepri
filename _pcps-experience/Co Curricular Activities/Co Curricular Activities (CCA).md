### CCA IN GENERAL

*   Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) is&nbsp;a non-academic activity that all students must undertake as part of their education outside of official school hours.&nbsp;
*   They are only introduced from Primary 3 onwards and is optional, not compulsory.&nbsp;
*   These activities are crucial as they offer supplementary opportunities for your child to explore their interests or develop them into hobbies like art or dance.&nbsp;
*   It is a key component of students’ holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents.&nbsp;
*   Students develop their character, learn values, social emotional competencies and skills to prepare them for future challenges.

### DEPARTMENT MISSION

To foster a passionate, artful and collaborative experience in learning and appreciating the English language.
  
### KEY PROGRAMMES  

##### STELLAR (MOE, Singapore)

STELLAR stands for “Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading”.

It is an English instructional programme developed for primary schools that enables us to teach our              children the critical life skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing in English through effective and          engaging strategies that are developmentally appropriate. 

  
The programme employs the following strategies: 

<u>Shared Book Approach (SBA)</u>

The teacher introduces and shares a Big Book with the pupils. Students are then taught language items, structures and skills explicitly, including concepts of print, phonics and grammar.  
  
  
<u>Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)</u>

Students are provided experiences based on text they have read in the classroom. These experiences come in the form of art and craft, drama or other novel activities.

Engagement in the above activity provides the context and content for the children to think and talk about, using the target language structures and vocabulary they have been exposed to in SBA.  
  
With the help of the teacher who transcribes the children's input, the pupils come up with a piece of class writing. This becomes the basis for group writing, when the children work in small groups, before they go on to individual writing.  
  
  
<u>Learning Centres (LC)</u>    
 The language skills learnt in both SBA and MLEA are reinforced in the Learning Centres (LC). In LC, activities are planned and differentiated for the students. It is here that students have the opportunity to re-learn, revisit or extend their learning at their own pace and in differentiated ability groups.

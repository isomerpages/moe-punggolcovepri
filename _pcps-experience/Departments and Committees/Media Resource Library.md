<h3>Committee Mission</h3>
<p>To nurture lifelong learners and confident communicators by providing
a welcoming space where every student discovers the joy of reading and
learning, stays curious, and explores knowledge and ideas through diverse
media and resources.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<h4>Weekly Library lessons</h4>
<p>Lower primary students will get to go to the school library every week.
This forms the foundation of our programme, where lower primary students
have the opportunity to borrow books regularly, learn proper library etiquette,
and share their reading adventures with classmates. These sessions build
confidence and create a strong reading culture from their early years.</p>

<h4>Thematic Displays</h4>
<p>The Media Resource Library has periodic updates to the displays and students
can look forward to different displays, depending on the themes such as
animals or plants. These dynamic displays spark curiosity and provide natural
conversation starters that encourage exploration and learning.</p>

<h4>English and Mother Tongue Story-telling sessions</h4>
<p>Primary 1 to 3 students will have opportunities to listen to English and
Mother Tongue stories as shared by teachers and parent volunteers. These
sessions celebrate our multicultural heritage whilst teaching important
values and fostering appreciation for different festivals and traditions.</p>

<h4>Star Readers awards</h4>
<p>The Star Readers award celebrates our most enthusiastic readers for each
term, recognising students who have read the most number of books from
the Media Resource Library. This can be either English or Mother Tongue
Language books. This motivates students whilst acknowledging their reading
achievements.</p>

<h4>MRL Week and Character Day</h4>
<p>Started in 2025, the Media Resource Library (MRL) Week and Character Day
is a week-long programme that promotes healthy screen time habits whilst
encouraging reading as an engaging alternative. The week then culminates
in our beloved Character Day, where students dress as their favourite literary
characters, bringing stories to life throughout our school.</p>

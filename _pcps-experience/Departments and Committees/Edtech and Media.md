#### COMMITTEE MISSION
ICT as an enabler – Connecting People, Transforming Ideas, Enabling the Future

#### OVERVIEW
EdTech and Media Committee supports the school in the use of New Media and ICT to bring about quality teaching and learning for our staff and students, with the aim to connect the community, transform ideas, and enable the future.

With an understanding of our students’ and teachers’ readiness in the use of New Media and ICT, we work with different departments to customise New Media and ICT infused programmes to meet the various learning objectives. The design and development of the programmes and lessons are grounded in our school values of Mindfulness, Empathy and Care, and guided by MOE’s ICT-in-Education Masterplan 4 (MP4) and Baseline ICT Standards. 


Within the supportive ecosystem, there is regular review to ensure the alignment of the programmes to MOE ICT Masterplans, Baseline ICT Standards, and school initiatives.

We aim to productively utilize New Media and ICT for our students’ quality learning in support of the total curriculum, and to support our students to be confident creators.

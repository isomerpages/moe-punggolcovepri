<h3>Committee Mission</h3>
<p>ICT as an enabler – Connecting People, Transforming Ideas, Enabling the
Future</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The EdTech and Media Committee plays a pivotal role in advancing the strategic
integration of New Media and Information and Communications Technology
(ICT) across the school. Our mission is to enhance the quality of teaching
and learning through purposeful technological adoption, fostering connections
within our school community, enhancing pedagogical practices, and preparing
our students for future success.</p>
<p>Our approach is grounded in a comprehensive understanding of both students'
and teachers' readiness levels in utilising New Media and ICT tools. Through
close collaboration with various departments, we design and implement customised
technology-enhanced programmes that align with specific learning objectives
whilst remaining firmly rooted in our school values of Mindfulness, Empathy
and Care. All initiatives are developed in accordance with the MOE EdTech
Masterplan 2030 and the Digital Literacy and Technological Skills framework,
ensuring coherence with national educational priorities.</p>
<p>The committee operates within a robust and supportive ecosystem that emphasizes
continuous improvement. Regular reviews are conducted to ensure our programmes
maintain alignment with MOE national initiatives and support broader school
initiatives. This systematic approach enables us to remain responsive to
evolving educational needs whilst maintaining high standards of implementation.</p>
<p>Our overarching goal is to harness New Media and ICT productively in support
of the total curriculum, creating meaningful learning experiences that
develop our students into curious lifelong learners, confident leaders,
and responsible innovators equipped for the demands of an increasingly
digital world.</p>

<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<h4>New MICT lessons</h4>
<p>The New Media and ICT (New MICT) curriculum provides structured, explicit
instruction in baseline EdTech and Media skills for Primary 1 and Primary
2 students through two dedicated periods per week. The curriculum is carefully
designed to introduce foundational skills systematically, whilst providing
students with authentic opportunities to apply their learning through different
level-based projects. Students are empowered to exercise choice in their
creative processes, fostering both technical proficiency and independent
thinking.</p>
<p>By the end of Primary 2, students will have developed fundamental competencies
across a range of digital skills and platforms, including touch typing,
Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, and introductory coding. This foundation
equips students to work and learn more independently and effectively with
ICT tools throughout their subsequent years of education.</p>
<p>The competencies acquired during the New MICT lessons serve as essential
building blocks that enable meaningful technology-enhanced learning across
the total curriculum. These skills are strategically leveraged in later
years to support deeper engagement with New Media and ICT-infused learning
experiences, ensuring that our students develop as confident and digitally
empowered learners.</p>

<h5>Developing responsible users for safe interaction with technology</h5>
<p>The Cyber Wellness programme at PCPS is designed to cultivate responsible
digital citizenship by raising awareness and equipping students with the
knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the online environment safely
and responsibly. The programme enables students to understand appropriate
online behaviour and empowers them to take ownership of their well-being
in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness education is delivered through multiple touchpoints to
ensure comprehensive coverage. Core lessons are conducted during the weekly
Form Teachers' Guidance Period (FTGP), complemented by the integration
of cyber wellness themes within the Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) curriculum and relevant academic subjects where appropriate. This
multi-faceted approach ensures that cyber wellness principles are consistently
reinforced across the curriculum.</p>
<p>In collaboration with the Student Leadership Committee, the school develops
and nurtures a dedicated group of Cyber Wellness Ambassadors. These student
leaders promote a positive cyber culture within the school community, championing
cyber wellness initiatives through various platforms and peer-led activities.</p>

<h4>Coding</h4>
<p>In alignment with IMDA’s Smart Nation 2.0 and MOE’s EdTech Masterplan
2030, the Code for Fun programme teaches and guides our students to become
curious, confident and creative users of technology, equipping them with
essential skillsets for success in a digital future.</p>
<p>The programme provides foundational exposure across key areas of digital
literacy, including Computational Thinking, coding through robotics, and
introduction to emerging technologies. Through hands-on learning experiences,
students develop problem-solving capabilities and gain practical understanding
of how technology shapes the world around them.</p>
<p>At PCPS, Primary 4 and Primary 6 students participate in the Code for
Fun programme as part of their post-End of Year examinations and post-PSLE
activities respectively. These enrichment sessions are designed to excite
students about new opportunities in the digital economy whilst establishing
a strong foundation in digital skills. Through this structured exposure,
students are better prepared to engage with increasingly sophisticated
technology in their future educational journey.</p>

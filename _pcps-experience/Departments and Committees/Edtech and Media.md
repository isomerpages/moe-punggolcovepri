<h3>Committee Mission</h3>
<p>ICT as an enabler – Connecting People, Transforming Ideas, Enabling the
Future</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>EdTech and Media Committee supports the school in the use of New Media
and ICT to bring about quality teaching and learning for our staff and
students, with the aim to connect the community, transform ideas, and enable
the future.</p>
<p>With an understanding of our students’ and teachers’ readiness in the
use of New Media and ICT, we work with different departments to customise
New Media and ICT infused programmes to meet the various learning objectives.
The design and development of the programmes and lessons are grounded in
our school values of Mindfulness, Empathy and Care, and guided by MOE’s
ICT-in-Education Masterplan 4 (MP4) and Baseline ICT Standards.</p>
<p>Within the supportive ecosystem, there is regular review to ensure the
alignment of the programmes to MOE ICT Masterplans, Baseline ICT Standards,
and school initiatives.</p>
<p>We aim to productively utilize New Media and ICT for our students’ quality
learning in support of the total curriculum, and to support our students
to be confident creators.</p>

<h5>ICT-in-Education Masterplan 4</h5>
<p>Currently at the fourth Masterplan for ICT in Education (MP4), MOE continues
to build on the achievements of the first three Masterplans to broaden
the focus beyond Self-Directed Learning and Collaborative Learning to the
Total Curriculum. In MP4, ICT is used productively to develop knowledge
through subject mastery, skills through 21st Century Competencies, and
attitudes through responsible digital citizenry, following MOE’s direction
towards student-centric and values-driven education.</p>
<p>At PCPS, we are constantly guided by the vision of MP4 to nurture “Future-ready
and Responsible Digital Learners”, with the&nbsp;goal to put “Quality Learning
in the Hands of Every Learner - Empowered with Technology”.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Baseline ICT Standards</h5>
<p>The Baseline ICT Standards is a set of New Media Literacies with competencies
to Curate, Create and Connect contents in the digital environment. These
knowledge, skills and values are taught to students explicitly and implicitly
through our customized New Media and ICT (New MICT) curriculum.</p>
<h5>Alignment To School Values</h5>
<p>With our PCPS vision of “Every student an educated child and contributing
citizen, ready to serve and lead”, we are mindfully anchored in our school
values in assessing curriculum needs and design.</p>

<p>For 2 periods a week, New Media and ICT competencies are taught explicitly
to the Primary 1 and Primary 2 students during New MICT lessons. These
competencies are purposefully introduced and students are given opportunities
to apply their learning, and to have choices about what and how to create.</p>
<p>By the end of Primary 2, PCPS students would have acquired basic competency
with Touch Typing, Microsoft Powerpoint, Microsoft Word and Coding amongst
other digital skills/platforms, and be able to work more independently
and fruitfully with ICT tools. These skills would be capitalized on to
enable New Media and ICT infused learning throughout their schooling years.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Purposeful Tools For Quality Learning</h5>
<p>With the basic New Media and ICT knowledge and skills that students have
acquired, teachers are better able to harness the ICT tools to facilitate
quality and active learning in all subject areas.</p>
<p>Other New Media and ICT skills are meaningfully integrated into the various
level ALP and Cyber Wellness programmes, and taught by the teachers as
follows:</p>

<h5>Regular Reviews for Purpose and Effectiveness</h5>
<p>Through regular monitoring,&nbsp;evaluation and reviews, the committee
constantly identify areas to refine the purposeful practices. At the same

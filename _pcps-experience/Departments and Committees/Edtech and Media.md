<h3>Committee Mission</h3>
<p>ICT as an enabler – Connecting People, Transforming Ideas, Enabling the
Future</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The EdTech and Media Committee plays a pivotal role in advancing the strategic
integration of New Media and Information and Communications Technology
(ICT) across the school. Our mission is to enhance the quality of teaching
and learning through purposeful technological adoption, fostering connections
within our school community, enhancing pedagogical practices, and preparing
our students for future success.</p>
<p>Our approach is grounded in a comprehensive understanding of both students'
and teachers' readiness levels in utilising New Media and ICT tools. Through
close collaboration with various departments, we design and implement customised
technology-enhanced programmes that align with specific learning objectives
whilst remaining firmly rooted in our school values of Mindfulness, Empathy
and Care. All initiatives are developed in accordance with the MOE EdTech
Masterplan 2030 and the Digital Literacy and Technological Skills framework,
ensuring coherence with national educational priorities.</p>
<p>The committee operates within a robust and supportive ecosystem that emphasizes
continuous improvement. Regular reviews are conducted to ensure our programmes
maintain alignment with MOE national initiatives and support broader school
initiatives. This systematic approach enables us to remain responsive to
evolving educational needs whilst maintaining high standards of implementation.</p>
<p>Our overarching goal is to harness New Media and ICT productively in support
of the total curriculum, creating meaningful learning experiences that
develop our students into curious lifelong learners, confident leaders,
and responsible innovators equipped for the demands of an increasingly
digital world.</p>

<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<h4>New MICT lessons</h4>
<p>The New Media and ICT (New MICT) curriculum provides structured, explicit
instruction in baseline EdTech and Media skills for Primary 1 and Primary
2 students through two dedicated periods per week. The curriculum is carefully
designed to introduce foundational skills systematically, whilst providing
students with authentic opportunities to apply their learning through different
level-based projects. Students are empowered to exercise choice in their
creative processes, fostering both technical proficiency and independent
thinking.</p>
<p>By the end of Primary 2, students will have developed fundamental competencies
across a range of digital skills and platforms, including touch typing,
Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, and introductory coding. This foundation
equips students to work and learn more independently and effectively with
ICT tools throughout their subsequent years of education.</p>
<p>The competencies acquired during the New MICT lessons serve as essential
building blocks that enable meaningful technology-enhanced learning across
the total curriculum. These skills are strategically leveraged in later
years to support deeper engagement with New Media and ICT-infused learning
experiences, ensuring that our students develop as confident and digitally
empowered learners.</p>

<h5>Developing responsible users for safe interaction with technology</h5>
<p>The Cyber Wellness programme at PCPS is designed to cultivate responsible
digital citizenship by raising awareness and equipping students with the
knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the online environment safely
and responsibly. The programme enables students to understand appropriate
online behaviour and empowers them to take ownership of their well-being
in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness education is delivered through multiple touchpoints to
ensure comprehensive coverage. Core lessons are conducted during the weekly
Form Teachers' Guidance Period (FTGP), complemented by the integration
of cyber wellness themes within the Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) curriculum and relevant academic subjects where appropriate. This
multi-faceted approach ensures that cyber wellness principles are consistently
reinforced across the curriculum.</p>
<p>In collaboration with the Student Leadership Committee, the school develops
and nurtures a dedicated group of Cyber Wellness Ambassadors. These student
leaders promote a positive cyber culture within the school community, championing
cyber wellness initiatives through various platforms and peer-led activities.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>Alignment To School Values</h5>
<p>With our PCPS vision of “Every student an educated child and contributing
citizen, ready to serve and lead”, we are mindfully anchored in our school
values in assessing curriculum needs and design.</p>

<p>For 2 periods a week, New Media and ICT competencies are taught explicitly
to the Primary 1 and Primary 2 students during New MICT lessons. These
competencies are purposefully introduced and students are given opportunities
to apply their learning, and to have choices about what and how to create.</p>
<p>By the end of Primary 2, PCPS students would have acquired basic competency
with Touch Typing, Microsoft Powerpoint, Microsoft Word and Coding amongst
other digital skills/platforms, and be able to work more independently
and fruitfully with ICT tools. These skills would be capitalized on to
enable New Media and ICT infused learning throughout their schooling years.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Purposeful Tools For Quality Learning</h5>
<p>With the basic New Media and ICT knowledge and skills that students have
acquired, teachers are better able to harness the ICT tools to facilitate
quality and active learning in all subject areas.</p>
<p>Other New Media and ICT skills are meaningfully integrated into the various
level ALP and Cyber Wellness programmes, and taught by the teachers as
follows:</p>

<h5>Regular Reviews for Purpose and Effectiveness</h5>
<p>Through regular monitoring,&nbsp;evaluation and reviews, the committee
constantly identify areas to refine the purposeful practices. At the same
time, a keen lookout is kept for new ways to support the school in their
New Media and ICT needs, and to further the incorporation of New Media&nbsp;and
ICT in support of the total curriculum.</p>

#### DEPARTMENT MISSION  

To enable all pupils to: 
*   build confidence and foster interest in mathematics   
*   acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous learning in mathematics  
*   develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving.

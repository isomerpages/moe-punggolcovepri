<h2>Department Mission</h2>
<p>Nurturing confident communicators and collaborators.</p>
<h2>Key Programmes</h2>
<h3>1. STELLAR (MOE, Singapore)</h3>
<p>STELLAR stands for “Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading”.</p>
<p>It is an English instructional programme developed for primary schools
that enables us to teach our children the critical life skills of listening,
speaking, reading and writing in English&nbsp;through effective and engaging
strategies that are developmentally appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programme employs the following strategies:</p>
<h4><u>Shared Book Approach (SBA)</u></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English Department 2026/ELD_1.jpg">
</div>
<p>The teacher introduces and shares a Big Book with the pupils. Students
are then taught language items, structures and skills explicitly, including
concepts of print, phonics and grammar.</p>
<h4><u>Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)</u></h4>
<p>Students engage in activities inspired by the STELLAR books they read
in class. These experiences include art and craft, drama, and other engaging
activities.</p>
<p>The Primary 1 students made their own paper lanterns during the unit <em>‘Mid-Autumn Festival’</em>.</p>

<p>The Primary 2 students have the amazing opportunity to witness the metamorphosis
of a butterfly right in their own classroom!</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English Department 2026/ELD_3.jpg">
</div>
<p>Engagement in such activities provides the context and content for the
children to think and talk about, using the target language structures
and vocabulary they have been exposed to in SBA.</p>
<p>With the help of the teacher who transcribes the children's input, the
pupils come up with a piece of class writing. This becomes the basis for
group writing when the children work in small groups, before they go on
to individual writing.</p>
<h4><u>Dramatisation @ PCP</u></h4>
<p>Students are given opportunities to bring the stories from their English
lessons to life through dramatisation. This helps them to understand the
story better.</p>

<p><em>Dramatising the story, ‘A Butterfly is Born’.</em>
</p>
<h4><u>Literacy Stations</u></h4>
<p>The language skills learnt in both SBA and MLEA are reinforced in Literacy
Stations. Activities are planned and differentiated for the students. Students
have the opportunity to re-learn, revisit or extend their learning at their
own pace and in differentiated ability groups.</p>

<h3>2. School-Based Curriculum</h3>
<p>The department has put together a series of programmes to complement STELLAR,
so as to enhance the teaching and learning of the English language.</p>

<p>Literature-based instruction is the type of instruction in which authors'
original narrative and expository works are used as the core for experiences
to support children in developing literacy.
<br>
<br>In addition to STELLAR lessons students are exposed to authentic and rich
models of language through the incorporation of mentor texts in teaching
reading, writing, listening and speaking. The texts also serve to inculcate
creative and critical thinking in our students.

<h3>3. English Fiesta</h3>
<p>The annual English Fiesta is held with the aim of creating opportunities
for our students to learn and celebrate the English language in various
forms.</p>
<p>Students are immersed in an array of indoor as well as outdoor activities.
Some of these activities include games carnival, authors’ display, poetry
appreciation, oral comprehension task and literature appreciation. The
carefully crafted activities create a meaningful context for language use
while increasing learner motivation.</p>

<h3>5.&nbsp;Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – English language</h3>
<h4><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – English language &amp; ICT collaboration</strong></h4>
<p><em>C<sup>3 </sup></em>- Confident Communicators and Collaborators</p>

<p>At Punggol Cove Primary School, we envision every student to be a Curious
Lifelong Learner, a Confident Leader and a Responsible Innovator, ready
to serve and lead. The Applied Learning Programme (ALP)- C^3- Confident
Communicators and Collaborators- empowers students to apply their learning
from English and New Media &amp; ICT classrooms in meaningful service to
the school and wider community.</p>
<p>Through real-world problem-solving, the programme nurtures curious lifelong
learners, confident leaders, and responsible individuals. It develops critical
thinking, collaboration and effective communication through writing and
oracy, while strengthening students’ understanding of global and societal
issues.</p>
<p>Advocacy-based learning activities are thoughtfully designed across three
learner blocks—lower primary, middle primary, and upper primary—and are
categorised into direct service, indirect service, and advocacy.</p>
<p>At the lower-primary level, programmes are designed with elements of problem-based
learning to cultivate empathy and lay the foundation for collaborative
problem-solving.</p>
<p>As students progress to the middle and upper-primary levels, Design Thinking
(DT) is introduced to guide them in developing innovative and purposeful
solutions, empowering them to express ideas clearly and inspire positive
change in authentic, meaningful contexts.</p>

<h3>Department Mission</h3>
<p>To foster a passionate, artful and collaborative experience in learning
and appreciating the English language.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<h5>STELLAR (MOE, Singapore)</h5>
<p>STELLAR stands for “Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading”.</p>
<p>It is an English instructional programme developed for primary schools
that enables us to teach our children the critical life skills of listening,
speaking, reading and writing in English&nbsp;through effective and engaging
strategies that are developmentally appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programme employs the following strategies:</p>
<p><u>Shared Book Approach (SBA)</u>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:45%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/eng1.jpeg">
</div>
<p>The teacher introduces and shares a Big Book with the pupils. Students
are then taught language items, structures and skills explicitly, including
concepts of print, phonics and grammar.</p>
<p><u>Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)</u>
</p>
<p>Students are provided experiences based on text they have read in the
classroom. These experiences come in the form of art and craft, drama or
other novel activities.&nbsp;

<p>Drama @ PCPS</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:75%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/eng3.png">
</div>
<p>Engagement in the above activity provides the context and content for
the children to think and talk about, using the target language structures
and vocabulary they have been exposed to in SBA.</p>
<p>With the help of the teacher who transcribes the children's input, the
pupils come up with a piece of class writing. This becomes the basis for
group writing, when the children work in small groups, before they go on
to individual writing.</p>
<p><u>Learning Centres (LC)</u>
<br>&nbsp;The language skills learnt in both SBA and MLEA are reinforced in
the Learning Centres (LC). In LC,&nbsp;activities are planned and differentiated
for the students. It is here that students have the&nbsp;opportunity to
re-learn, revisit or extend their learning at their own pace and in differentiated
ability groups.</p>

<p>Literature-based instruction is the type of instruction in which authors'
original narrative and expository works are used as the core for experiences
to support children in developing literacy.
<br>
<br>In addition to STELLAR lessons students are exposed to authentic and rich
models of language through the incorporation of mentor texts in teaching
reading, writing, listening and speaking. The texts also serve to inculcate
creative and critical thinking in our students.

<h5>3. English Fiesta</h5>
<p>The annual English Fiesta is held with the aim of creating opportunities
for our students to learn and celebrate the English language in various
forms.</p>
<p>Students are immersed in an array of indoor as well as outdoor activities.
Some of these activities include games carnival, authors’ display, poetry

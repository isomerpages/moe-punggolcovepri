    <div>
      <p>Programmes and initiatives are carefully curated according to CW themes, keeping in mind the current affairs in our cyber world.<br>1.<strong><em> Class Talks</em></strong><br>In Term 1, each level will go through a Cyber Wellness class talk to have a better understanding of the main CW theme of the level.<br>2.<strong><em> SLS Lessons in Term 2 and Term 4</em></strong><br>As a follow-up to the class talk, students will recap and be engaged in activities related to the CW theme. This allows students to learn and apply their skills in scenario-based questions and Cyber Wellness-related games.<br>3.<strong><em> Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors (CWSAs)</em></strong><br>CWSAs are role models who actively influence their peers to create a safe and kind online community. They do this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guiding their peers on how to behave in the digital world</li>
<li>Championing school-wide CW outreach efforts</li>
</ul>
<p>CWSAs are given opportunities to attend workshops and be part of CW projects to create awareness about CW in school.&nbsp;</p>

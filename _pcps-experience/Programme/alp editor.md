      <p>This problem-based learning programme was initiated so as to empower students to use their learning from the English and New Media & ICT classroom in service to the school and community.<br>
The service learning activities are represented in different forms amongst the three learner blocks: lower primary, middle primary and upper primary. The activities are further categorised into direct service, indirect service, and advocacy.<br><br>Some examples of activities conducted in this programme are listed in the table below:<style type="text/css">

			<p><b>AIM:</b><br>Building on their knowledge about animals from books read in the English classroom, the Primary 1 Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to provide students with opportunities to learn about endangered animals and advocate animal conservation.<br>Using problem-based learning (PBL), each P1 class brainstorms and researches on a selected animal. Students then embark on a ‘learning experience’ to learn more about the selected animal.<br>The information gathered by the different classes is then shared and presented in the form of e-posters; thus building on each other’s repertoire of knowledge.<img src="/images/alpp1-1.png"

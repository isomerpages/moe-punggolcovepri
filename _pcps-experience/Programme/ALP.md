The activities are further categorised into direct service, indirect service, and advocacy.<br><br>Some examples of activities conducted in this programme are listed in the table below:<style type="text/css">

			<p><b>AIM:</b><br>Building on their knowledge about animals from books read in the English classroom, the Primary 1 Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to provide students with opportunities to learn about endangered animals and advocate animal conservation.<br>Using problem-based learning (PBL), each P1 class brainstorms and researches on a selected animal. Students then embark on a ‘learning experience’ to learn more about the selected animal.<br>The information gathered by the different classes is then shared and presented in the form of e-posters; thus building on each other’s repertoire of knowledge.<img src="/images/alpp1-1.png"

			<p><b>AIM:</b><br>Having completed the first year at primary school, students at the primary 2 level put their heads together to walk down memory lane and reminisce the time when they had newly transited to primary school. Putting the school value of empathy to good use by identifying the needs of incoming primary 1 students, these seniors work on solutions and advice for their juniors to ease this transition for them. <img src="/images/P2-1.jpeg"

			<p><b>AIM:</b><br>In a bid to bring about awareness of cyber safety and encourage cyber wellness practice amongst the school community, students at the primary 3 level take on the role of ambassadors and share the message of Cyber Wellness through self-created videos.<br>They apply their language skills of writing, speaking and presenting along with their newly learnt skills of videography and use this to spread the message of being a responsible digital learner.<br>Each class focuses on a different strand of cyber wellness education from cyber identity to cyber relationships and even cyber citizenship.<img src="/images/p3-1.jpeg"

The Primary 6 students embark on their ALP projects as part of their post-examination engagement at the end of the year. Working together as a class, students must compose an original piece of music using the software Chrome Music Lab. They will then come up with accompanying lyrics to complement their melody. Through songwriting, the Primary 6 students can express their gratitude to the school and ruminate on their experiences while celebrating the friendships that were forged in their time in primary school.<br><img src="/images/P6-1.jpeg"

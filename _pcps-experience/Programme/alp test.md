<p><strong>AIM:</strong><br />Building on their knowledge about animals from books read in the English classroom, the Primary 1 Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to provide students with opportunities to learn about endangered animals and advocate animal conservation.<br />Using problem-based learning (PBL), each P1 class brainstorms and researches on a selected animal. Students then embark on a &lsquo;learning experience&rsquo; to learn more about the selected animal.<br />The information gathered by the different classes is then shared and presented in the form of e-posters; thus building on each other&rsquo;s repertoire of knowledge.<img src="/images/alpp1-1.png" /><img src="/images/alpp1-2.png" /></p>

<p><strong>AIM:</strong><br />Having completed the first year at primary school, students at the primary 2 level put their heads together to walk down memory lane and reminisce the time when they had newly transited to primary school. Putting the school value of empathy to good use by identifying the needs of incoming primary 1 students, these seniors work on solutions and advice for their juniors to ease this transition for them. <img src="/images/P2-1.jpeg" /><img src="/images/P2-2.jpeg" /><img src="/images/P2-3.png" /></p>

<p>At Punggol Cove Primary School, we envision every student to be a Curious
Lifelong Learner, a Confident Leader and a Responsible Innovator, ready
to serve and lead. The Applied Learning Programme (ALP)- C^3- Confident
Communicators and Collaborators- empowers students to apply their learning
from English and New Media &amp; ICT classrooms in meaningful service to
the school and wider community.</p>
<p>Through real-world problem-solving, the programme nurtures curious lifelong
learners, confident leaders, and responsible individuals. It develops critical
thinking, collaboration and effective communication through writing and
oracy, while strengthening students’ understanding of global and societal
issues.</p>
<p>Advocacy-based learning activities are thoughtfully designed across three
learner blocks—lower primary, middle primary, and upper primary—and are
categorised into direct service, indirect service, and advocacy. At the
lower-primary level, programmes are designed with elements of problem-based
learning to cultivate empathy and lay the foundation for collaborative
problem-solving.</p>
<p>As students progress to the middle and upper-primary levels, Design Thinking
(DT) is introduced to guide them in developing innovative and purposeful
solutions, empowering them to express ideas clearly and inspire positive
change in authentic, meaningful contexts.</p>
<p>Some examples of activities conducted in this programme are listed in
the table below:</p>

<h4>Primary 1</h4>
<p>Building on their knowledge about animals from books read in the English
classroom, the Primary 1 Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to provide
students with opportunities to learn about endangered animals and advocate
animal conservation.</p>
<p>Through authentic and experiential learning, supported by elements of
problem-based learning (PBL), each P1 class researches on a selected endangered
animal. Students then embark on a learning experience to the Singapore
Zoo to learn more about the selected animal.</p>
<p>The information gathered by the different classes is then shared and presented
in the form of class writing and e-posters; thus building on each other’s
repertoire of knowledge.</p>

<p>Primary 2</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AIM:</strong>
<br>Having completed the first year at primary school, students at the primary
2 level put their heads together to walk down memory lane and reminisce
the time when they had newly transited to primary school. Putting the school
value of empathy to good use by identifying the needs of incoming primary
1 students, these seniors work on solutions and advice for their juniors
to ease this transition for them.</p>

<h4>Primary 3</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AIM:</strong>
<br>In a bid to bring about awareness of cyber safety and encourage cyber
wellness practice amongst the school community, students at the primary
3 level take on the role of ambassadors and share the message of Cyber
Wellness through self-created videos.
<br>They apply their language skills of writing, speaking and presenting along
with their newly learnt skills of videography and use this to spread the
message of being a responsible digital learner.
<br>Each class focuses on a different strand of cyber wellness education from
cyber identity to cyber relationships and even cyber citizenship.</p>

<h4>Primary 6</h4>
<ul>

<p><strong>AIM:</strong>
<br>The Primary 6 students embark on their ALP projects as part of their post-examination
engagement at the end of the year. Working together as a class, students
must compose an original piece of music using the software Chrome Music
Lab. They will then come up with accompanying lyrics to complement their
melody. Through songwriting, the Primary 6 students can express their gratitude
to the school and ruminate on their experiences while celebrating the friendships
that were forged in their time in primary school.

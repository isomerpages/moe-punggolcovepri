<h3>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – English language &amp; ICT collaboration</h3>
<h4>Holistic English Literacy Programme (HELP)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This problem-based learning programme was initiated so as to empower students
to use their learning from the English and New Media &amp; ICT classroom
in service to the school and community.
<br>The service learning activities are represented in different forms amongst
the three learner blocks: lower primary, middle primary and upper primary.
The activities are further categorised into direct service, indirect service,
and advocacy.
<br>
<br>Some examples of activities conducted in this programme are listed in
the table below:</p>

<h4>Primary 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AIM:</strong>
<br>Building on their knowledge about animals from books read in the English
classroom, the Primary 1 Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to provide
students with opportunities to learn about endangered animals and advocate
animal conservation.
<br>Using problem-based learning (PBL), each P1 class brainstorms and researches
on a selected animal. Students then embark on a ‘learning experience’ to
learn more about the selected animal.
<br>The information gathered by the different classes is then shared and presented
in the form of e-posters; thus building on each other’s repertoire of knowledge.</p>

<h4>Primary 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AIM:</strong>
<br>Having completed the first year at primary school, students at the primary
2 level put their heads together to walk down memory lane and reminisce
the time when they had newly transited to primary school. Putting the school
value of empathy to good use by identifying the needs of incoming primary
1 students, these seniors work on solutions and advice for their juniors
to ease this transition for them.</p>

<h4>Primary 3</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AIM:</strong>
<br>In a bid to bring about awareness of cyber safety and encourage cyber
wellness practice amongst the school community, students at the primary
3 level take on the role of ambassadors and share the message of Cyber
Wellness through self-created videos.
<br>They apply their language skills of writing, speaking and presenting along
with their newly learnt skills of videography and use this to spread the
message of being a responsible digital learner.
<br>Each class focuses on a different strand of cyber wellness education from
cyber identity to cyber relationships and even cyber citizenship.</p>

<h4>Primary 4</h4>

<p><strong>AIM:</strong>
<br>The programme aims to cultivate the spirit of innovation while upholding
the school values of empathy and mindfulness as the primary 4 students
work collaboratively in advancing the reading interest of their younger
peers.
<br>They carry out surveys to understand the reading interest of their recipients
and create digital storybooks using Animaker to instill the love for reading
in their younger schoolmates.

<h4>Primary 5</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AIM:</strong>
<br>The programme aims to foster students’ speaking and writing skills through
activities that are centred in journalism. Students are given opportunities
to examine and discuss key issues from newspaper articles found in Little
Red Dot.
<br>
<br>Students are tasked to apply the elements of journalistic writing in creating
a class newspaper on addressing social issues and themes such as inclusive
society, social inequality and other pertinent issues.

<h4>Primary 6</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AIM:</strong>
<br>The Primary 6 students embark on their ALP projects as part of their post-examination
engagement at the end of the year. Working together as a class, students
must compose an original piece of music using the software Chrome Music
Lab. They will then come up with accompanying lyrics to complement their
melody. Through songwriting, the Primary 6 students can express their gratitude
to the school and ruminate on their experiences while celebrating the friendships
that were forged in their time in primary school.

<p>At Punggol Cove Primary School, we envision every student to be a Curious
Lifelong Learner, a Confident Leader and a Responsible Innovator, ready
to serve and lead. The Applied Learning Programme (ALP)- C^3- Confident
Communicators and Collaborators- empowers students to apply their learning
from English and New Media &amp; ICT classrooms in meaningful service to
the school and wider community.</p>
<p>Through real-world problem-solving, the programme nurtures curious lifelong
learners, confident leaders, and responsible individuals. It develops critical
thinking, collaboration and effective communication through writing and
oracy, while strengthening students’ understanding of global and societal
issues.</p>
<p>Advocacy-based learning activities are thoughtfully designed across three
learner blocks—lower primary, middle primary, and upper primary—and are
categorised into direct service, indirect service, and advocacy. At the
lower-primary level, programmes are designed with elements of problem-based
learning to cultivate empathy and lay the foundation for collaborative
problem-solving.</p>
<p>As students progress to the middle and upper-primary levels, Design Thinking
(DT) is introduced to guide them in developing innovative and purposeful
solutions, empowering them to express ideas clearly and inspire positive
change in authentic, meaningful contexts.</p>
<p>Some examples of activities conducted in this programme are listed in
the table below:</p>

<h4>Primary 1</h4>
<p>Building on their knowledge about animals from books read in the English
classroom, the Primary 1 Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to provide
students with opportunities to learn about endangered animals and advocate
animal conservation.</p>
<p>Through authentic and experiential learning, supported by elements of
problem-based learning (PBL), each P1 class researches on a selected endangered
animal. Students then embark on a learning experience to the Singapore
Zoo to learn more about the selected animal.</p>
<p>The information gathered by the different classes is then shared and presented
in the form of class writing and e-posters; thus building on each other’s
repertoire of knowledge.</p>

<h4>Primary 2</h4>
<p>With a focus on building empathy and learning through reflection, the
Primary 2 ALP draws on elements of problem-based learning (PBL) to guide
students in reflecting on their own experiences of transitioning into primary
school. Drawing on the school value of empathy, they identify the challenges
faced by incoming Primary 1 students and collaborate to develop meaningful
solutions and advice to support their juniors in easing into school life.</p>

<h4>Primary 3</h4>
<p>To raise awareness of cyber safety and promote cyber wellness practices
within the school community, Primary 3 students take on the role of ambassadors
of Cyber Wellness through podcasting. Guided by the design thinking process,
students empathise with the needs of their audience, craft meaningful messages,
and prototype engaging podcast episodes.</p>
<p>They apply their language skills—writing, speaking, and presenting—alongside
newly acquired podcasting techniques to advocate for responsible digital
citizenship. Each class explores a different strand of cyber wellness,
ranging from cyber identity and relationships to digital footprint and
cyber citizenship.</p>

<h4>Primary 4</h4>
<p>The programme adopts design thinking as a pedagogy to nurture innovation
while reinforcing the school values of empathy and mindfulness. Primary
4 students work collaboratively to spark reading interest in their younger
peers and impart values through storytelling.</p>
<p>Through the design thinking process, they conduct surveys to better understand
their recipients’ reading preferences and create digital storybooks using
Google Slides to inspire a love for reading. They then visit MK@PC to share
their completed digital story with the preschoolers.</p>

<h4>Primary 5</h4>
<p>The Primary 5 ALP is anchored in the Design Thinking process and carried
out in collaboration with the Caring Companions programme as part of the
students’ Values in Action (VIA) efforts. Students begin by researching
the lives and needs of the elderly in Singapore to develop empathy and
a deeper understanding of the challenges they face.</p>
<p>Guided by their research findings, students design and prototype interactive
games aimed at fostering meaningful engagement with the elderly during
their visits to elderly homes. Throughout the project, students document
their learning journey through multi-modal platforms, capturing their research,
ideation, testing, and reflections.</p>
<p>To conclude the programme, students produce a mini documentary that showcases
their design process, learning experiences, and insights, highlighting
themes of empathy, social responsibility, and purposeful communication.</p>

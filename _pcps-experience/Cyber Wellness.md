<h4>What is Cyber Wellness</h4>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of internet users.
<br>
<br>The focus of CW is to help our students to become responsible digital
learners by understanding online behaviors and being aware of how to protect
themselves in the online space.
<br>
<br>Students should also be positive peer influence and harness the power
of technology for the good of the community.</p>
<h4>MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework</h4>

<h4>3 principles of Cyber Wellness</h4>
<p>
<br>These 3 main principles will guide our students’ decision-making and anchor
their well-being:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Respect for self and others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safe and responsible use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positive peer influence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Through CW lessons, our student will be taught to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sense – Identify possible online risks and protect themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think – Analyse, evaluate and reflect on a situation based on the CW principles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Act – Take actions to keep safe and be a positive influence online.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>PCPS Cyber Wellness</h4>
<p>In order to equip students with lifelong social-emotional competencies
and sound values to become safe and responsible digital learners, our school’s
CW curriculum ties in closely with the CCE curriculum to bring about a
holistic CW education.

<h4>Baseline ICT Standards</h4>
<p>Baseline ICT standards are sets of essential soft and technical skills
students develop over the course of their education to prepare them for
the future.
<br>
<br>Our school’s CW themes are closely aligned to the Baseline ICT Standards
to meet the learning needs of our students.
<br>
<br>Here is an overview of the learning outcomes covered in our CW curriculum.

<h4>Our Programmes and Initiatives</h4>
<p>Programmes and initiatives are carefully curated according to CW themes,
keeping in mind the current affairs in our cyber world.
<br>1.<strong><em> Class Talks</em></strong>
<br>In Term 1, each level will go through a Cyber Wellness class talk to have
a better understanding of the main CW theme of the level.
<br>2.<strong><em> SLS Lessons in Term 2 and Term 4</em></strong>
<br>As a follow-up to the class talk, students will recap and be engaged in
activities related to the CW theme. This allows students to learn and apply
their skills in scenario-based questions and Cyber Wellness-related games.
<br>3.<strong><em> Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors (CWSAs)</em></strong>
<br>CWSAs are role models who actively influence their peers to create a safe
and kind online community. They do this through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Guiding their peers on how to behave in the digital world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Championing school-wide CW outreach efforts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CWSAs are given opportunities to attend workshops and be part of CW projects
to create awareness about CW in school.&nbsp;</p>

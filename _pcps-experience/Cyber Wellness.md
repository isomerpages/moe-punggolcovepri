<h3>What is Cyber Wellness</h3>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) in CCE focuses on the well-being of our students as
they navigate cyberspace. The CW curriculum aims to equip students with
the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes,
maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible
users of ICT.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Key Messages</h4>
<p>Through CW education in CCE, students learn to be respectful, safe, and
responsible users of technology and be a positive peer influence, advocating
for the good of the community online.</p>
<p>These are the key messages which students will understand:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle
between offline and online activities</p>

<p>Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online
presence</p>
</li>

<h4>3 principles of Cyber Wellness</h4>

<h4>Our Programmes and Initiatives</h4>
<p>Programmes and initiatives are carefully curated according to CW themes,
keeping in mind the current affairs in our cyber world.
<br>1.<strong><em> Class Talks</em></strong>
<br>In Term 1, each level will go through a Cyber Wellness class talk to have
a better understanding of the main CW theme of the level.
<br>2.<strong><em> SLS Lessons in Term 2 and Term 4</em></strong>
<br>As a follow-up to the class talk, students will recap and be engaged in
activities related to the CW theme. This allows students to learn and apply
their skills in scenario-based questions and Cyber Wellness-related games.
<br>3.<strong><em> Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors (CWSAs)</em></strong>
<br>CWSAs are role models who actively influence their peers to create a safe
and kind online community. They do this through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Guiding their peers on how to behave in the digital world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Championing school-wide CW outreach efforts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CWSAs are given opportunities to attend workshops and be part of CW projects
to create awareness about CW in school.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Home - Based Learning</strong></h2>
<p>At Punggol Cove Primary School, we are committed to nurture&nbsp;future-ready
and responsible learners. We&nbsp;believe in equipping them with the necessary
skills to leverage on technology to learn better.</p>
<p>As teachers will tap on a variety of&nbsp;online learning tools to complement
classroom teaching and learning, this website will provide a set of child-friendly
guides to help students navigate these tools while learning at their own
pace.</p>

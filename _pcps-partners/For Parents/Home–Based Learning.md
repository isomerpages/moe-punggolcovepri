At Punggol Cove Primary School, we are committed to nurture&nbsp;future-ready and responsible learners. We&nbsp;believe in equipping them with the necessary skills to leverage on technology to learn better.  

As teachers will tap on a variety of&nbsp;online learning tools to complement classroom teaching and learning, this website will provide a set of child-friendly guides to help students navigate these tools while learning at their own pace.

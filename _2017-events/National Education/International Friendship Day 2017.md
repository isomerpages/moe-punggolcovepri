Our school commemorated International Friendship Day in the fourth week of Term 2. This year marks the 50th anniversary of this union and the theme is ASEAN 50. To mark this milestone, the pupils of Punggol Cove Primary experienced a series of meaningful activities to deepen their understanding of our ASEAN neighbours.    
  
 After a sharing by our teachers on some facts about ASEAN countries during assembly, our Primary 1 pupils brainstormed on the qualities of a good friend. They then each picked a quality which they feel is most important and wrote it on their jigsaw piece. Each class then pieced their jigsaw together. This fun and interactive activity allowed pupils to understand that we each play an important role in maintaining good relationships with our ASEAN neighbours.      
  
The Primary 2 pupils completed an activity which helped them gain awareness of the flags of our ASEAN neighbours. After colouring their flags, each class created their own ASEAN flags bunting and hung it in their classrooms. Through this activity, our pupils understand the importance of respecting the cultures, beliefs and flags of other countries.

Total Defence Day 2017 was celebrated in a small yet meaningful scale.  The theme this year was “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”.    
  
Besides introducing and emphasizing on the five aspects of Total Defence, the focus this year was also on how pupils could play a part in keeping Singapore strong, learning the importance of working in unity, in defending Singapore and acquiring basic knowledge with regard to the role of National Service (NS50).    
  
Pupils experienced fire-drill to demonstrate the importance of taking care of one another in time of crisis.     
  
On top of that, Primary One pupils got to apply what they had learnt in the classroom, to decide which items to pack in a Ready Bag.     
  
As this year also marks the 50th year of National Service (NS50), Primary Two pupils focused on military defence aspect of Total Defence which included the role of NS, evolving around the elements of ‘care’ and ‘resilience’.

Kindness Week started with screening of a series of Kindness Cubbies video every morning.

During the Kindness Week, pupils learnt what it means to be a bucket filler to one another through a well-known story name ‘_Have You Filled A Bucket Today_?’ In addition, pupils were taught to differentiate the different characteristics of a bucket filler and bucket dipper.

The Primary One pupils also expressed their thoughts on what kindness mean to them through their drawings which reinforced their understanding about how to be kind to one another in their own capacity.

The Primary Two pupils were given the opportunity during the class activity to think of two tangible ways they would like to act upon in filling someone’s bucket.

The highlight of the week was when every pupil in the school get to participate in the school-wide kindness activity during recess by penning down notes of kindness and pasting them on the kindness tree located at the canteen area.

It was heartening to see many of our pupils have grown and blossomed throughout this week.

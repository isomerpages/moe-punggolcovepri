Pupils went through a two-days P1 Transition Programme to prepare and equip themselves for primary school life. Pupils were taught how to pack their school bags and various hygiene habits were instil in them as well.     
  
Pupils were also engaged in series of fun-filled activities and stronger bonds were forged between their teachers and classmates. Indeed, it was a memorable experience for the P1 children.

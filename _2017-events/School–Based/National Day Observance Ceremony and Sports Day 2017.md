National Day was celebrated with nostalgic National Day songs, beautiful singing, fun-filled activities and love!

Prior to the celebration, pupils practised the singing of the National Day theme song daily. Besides, they learnt about the celebration theme and penned their thoughts together as a class.  

This year National Police Cadet Corp and Girl Guides from Loyang Secondary School were invited to conduct the National Day Observance and flag-raising ceremony. It was a simple and solemn ceremony and our children were in awe!

After the ceremony, our children had a fun time playing games as part of their Sports Day. Importantly, such interaction allowed them to learn and understand the importance of sportsmanship and teamwork.

The theme for Total Defence Day 2022 was “Together, We Keep Singapore Strong”.    
  
For this year, students learn about the six pillars of Total Defence. In addition, students learnt about the importance of working together in unity, as a Singaporean citizen and resident, to defend Singapore.  

*   Primary One students learn that everyone can play their part to keep Singapore safe by first protecting their homes and neighbourhoods, especially during situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. 
*   Primary Two students learn about fire safety and the part they can play in it.  
*   Primary Three students learnt how they can contribute and strengthen Social Defence so that Singaporeans and residents may live together harmoniously.   
*   Primary Four students discussed how Psychological Defence is crucial to the unity of Singapore.   
*   Primary Five students learnt that Digital Defence is a whole-of-nation effort to protect and defend ourselves and our nation online.   
*   Primary Six students learnt how they can put Economic Defence in action. They are each given a set of SGUnite! Card Game which they played in class and brought home to play with the family.   

  

Our students are also briefed on the evacuation routes and what they should do during an emergency.   Although our students may be young, they understood their roles and responsibilities in keeping Singapore strong. They have certainly played their part in the nation’s efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic.

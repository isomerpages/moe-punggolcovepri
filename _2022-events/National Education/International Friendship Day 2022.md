The theme for International Friendship Day 2022 was “Singapore in Asia”.    Students from Primary One to Six were engaged in class discussions and activities that allowed them to recognise the importance of connectedness between our neighbouring countries so that they can play an active role in fostering people-to-people ties, and thus celebrate the region's diversity and vibrancy and promote the spirit of friendship and collaboration. In addition, our students learned about the culture, language, food and other aspects of Cambodia,

*   Primary One students modelled how to be good friends by writing good qualities about a friend. They learned the importance of being a good friend.   
*   Primary Two students learned about the different types of food relished by Asians and their origin.       
*   Primary Three students learned to identify the different Asian costumes. They learned that being harmonious with one another was an integral part of friendships.  
*   Primary Four students had a glimpse of festivals celebrated in Asia. They had the opportunity to share their favourite festival with their peers. 
*   Primary Five students learned about the contributions made by foreign job holders in Singapore and appreciated them for their contributions. 
*   Primary Six students were engaged in class discussions to learn about the importance of having a good relationship between Singapore and the rest of the ASEAN countries.      

  

From the IFD lesson packages, our students learned about the importance of practising mindfulness, empathy and care with one another.

National Day 2019 was celebrated with a lot of singing, interactive activities and games.

In the week leading up to National Day, students were singing the National Day theme songs and had fun learning about Singapore on the Interactive noticeboards and in their classrooms.

This year, we are pleased to have invited the Singapore Civil Defence Force to conduct a CPR-AED experiential learning lesson for our Primary 3 and Primary 4 students. Students learnt that they can actually play a part in helping people in need.

In addition, our Primary 1 and Primary 2 had fun playing inter-class games in the Hall.

The day ended on a high note as the Primary and Kindergarten students came together for a sing-along session as one Punggol Cove family!

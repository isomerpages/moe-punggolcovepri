The theme for International Friendship Day 2019 was “Connected Communities”.

This year, the pupils had the opportunity to immerse and find out more about the culture of ASEAN countries through the Classroom Activities during Social Studies.

* Primary One students focused on the importance of friendships between individuals/ classmates and how countries, just like them and their classmates, need to forge strong friendships, in order to reap the benefits of staying and working together as a community.
* Primary Two students learnt that when they make new friends, they can achieve success together. Friends can help each other in times of need. Friends understand each other better and this helps to build harmony.
* Primary Three students understand that it is important to know more about other countries’ cuisines so that they can be more sensitive to different cultures when it comes to food.
* Primary Four students discussed the importance of knowing more about other countries’ traditional costumes. They appreciate the influence of shared cultures in the clothing they wear.

At the end of the activity, the students are aware of the importance of respecting and learning the different backgrounds and experiences of people from our friends in Asia.

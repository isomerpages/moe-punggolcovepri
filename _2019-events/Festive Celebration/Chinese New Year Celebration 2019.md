The school celebrated Chinese New Year on 4th February 2019. Prior to that, students learnt to sing Chinese New Year songs during music lessons and decorated the classrooms in preparation for the celebration. 

This year, Punggol Cove Primary School continue to collaborate with our MOE Kindergarten whereby selected Primary 3 pupils displayed school values of mindfulness and care, leading the kindergarten in making Chinese New Year craft-work and showing appreciation to their loved ones.

On the day of celebration, pupils also learnt about Chinese New Year tradition and practised teamwork by making Chinese New Year collage during the classroom activity.

During the concert, pupils were awed in amusement as the performers displayed complex dance moves as part of a Chinese Dance performance with Chinese fan, puppet string lion and hover board. Our student counsellors have also took this opportunity to show appreciation to our teachers by presenting mandarin oranges. The simple and meaningful celebration, exposing pupils to Chinese culture, ended on a high note with mass singing.

Two weeks before Deepavali, pupils decorated their classrooms with posters, decorations   
and colouring of Deepavali. The picture provided for colouring were related to Deepavali.  Students were very participative during the colouring session and were forthcoming to help  
the teachers to put up the decorations. This invited the festive mood.

Following that, Deepavali concert was held during Assembly period.  Students were enlightened about how Deepavali is celebrated.  Along with that, students learnt about the significance of colours in Indian tradition.  Together with this, they had a visual feast of dance performance.  The performance featured different types of traditional Indian dances. ‘Kummi’ Dance was conducted as a mass dance. Students followed the steps taught by the dancers and they enjoyed clapping to the rhythm of the song.

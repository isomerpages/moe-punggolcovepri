The theme for Kindness Week 2019 was “Sprinkle Kindness to Others”.

Each level, from Primary One to Four, participated in activities that encouraged them to exercise kindness to one another.
* For the Primary 1 students, they learnt about the concept of the “Bucket Filler”. In the classroom, students were introduced to the idea of being a ‘Bucket Filler’ through the e-book “Have You Filled A Bucket Today?”.  Using the analogy of an ‘invisible bucket’, students are encouraged to fill up each other’s emotional banks through kind deeds or considerate acts.
* For the Primary 2 students, the students were re-introduced to the idea of being a ‘Bucket Filler’ through the video “How Full Is Your Bucket?”. They continued to learn about the ways a Bucket Filler should do. Both Primary One and Primary Two students were encouraged to come up with ways to show kindness to family and friends.  
* For the Primary 3 and 4 students, they learnt about ways they can be kind to our environment through the ways that they study, work and play. They learnt to practise everyday responsibilities such as throwing waste properly and keeping our toilets clean.

Although our students may be young, they understood that they can play their part to make Singapore a gracious society!

<p><strong>Ms Cai Xirui</strong>
</p>
<p>BECE (Hons), PGDE (Sec)</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Ms Cai Xirui was appointed Vice-Principal at Punggol Cove Primary School
on 15 December 2022. She started out as a teacher in Victoria Junior College
(VJC) in 2005. Ms Cai served as Subject Head for Project Work from 2008
to 2011, before holding the post of Head of Department for Project Work
from 2012 to 2022. During her years at VJC, she taught ‘A’ Level Physics
and ‘A’ Level Project Work to the students in the junior college section,
and Physics to students in the Victoria Integrated Programme. She was also
involved in leading a team of teachers to develop a set of rubrics for
the evaluation of 21st Century Competencies (21CCs) in the total curriculum.</p>
<p>During her stint as HOD (PW), Ms Cai and her department guided students
through their coursework-based ‘A’ Level Project Work Examination using
the Design Thinking approach. Design Thinking is a human-centred approach
which places the user at the core of the problem definition, as well as
the creative thinking process. In a world where problems are increasingly
complex, being sensitive to human needs, and working collaboratively with
others, through empathy, mindfulness and care, are essential.</p>
<p>Ms Cai strongly believes in the need for students to have opportunities
and guidance to hone their 21CCs. She hopes that through both the academic
and non-academic programme at PCPS, as well as partnership with parents
and important stakeholders, students will have experiences which enable
them to grow holistically. As they develop to become concerned citizens,
the students can then serve and lead, both themselves as well as their
communities, with purpose.</p>

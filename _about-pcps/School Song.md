<center><b><em>Set sail on a journey<br> 
Hand in hand with you and me<br> 
We care and share in harmony<br>
	As one big family</em></b></center>


<center><b><em>Look forth to the future 
Be strong and persevere 
Weâ€™ll brave through the storm with hope and pride 
Let our dreams take flight   


Chorus 
Mindfulness, Empathy and Care
Values that we share 
Reach out to all, lend a helping hand 
To Serve To Lead, Punggol Cove

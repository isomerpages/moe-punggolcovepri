<b><em>Set sail on a journey 
Hand in hand with you and me 
We care and share in harmony 
	As one big family</em></b>


Look forth to the future 
Be strong and persevere 
Weâ€™ll brave through the storm with hope and pride 
Let our dreams take flight   


Chorus 
Mindfulness, Empathy and Care
Values that we share 
Reach out to all, lend a helping hand 
To Serve To Lead, Punggol Cove   


To Serve To Lead, Punggol Cove

<p>The celebration started with Dr Janil being welcomed by our MOE Kindergarten
children and our pioneer batch of Scouts.
<br>
<br>Thereafter, all students from Kindergarten to Primary 3 presented several
mass song and dance items to mark this joyous occasion, followed by Dr
Janil’s official opening of the school.
<br>
<br>After the rousing performances put up by all our students, they then enjoyed
themselves with a Carnival, short film screening, and Scratch games created
by P3 students.
<br>
<br>We would like to thank our wonderful parent volunteers who helped to look
after the students and supported the teachers in running the activities.
<br>
<br>The many giving hearts and serving hands made this official opening a
memorable experience for all.</p>

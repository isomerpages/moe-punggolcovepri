<p>Punggol Cove Primary School endeavours to provide a safe and nurturing
environment for learning and growing. This is anchored in the belief that
every child can learn and must feel inspired to believe in himself or herself
as well as those around him or her. It strives to be student-centric with
an emphasis on total education. Through the meaningful curriculum developed
by our teachers, the school aims to develop in every child, 21st century
competencies that would prepare him or her for the world.</p>
<p>At Punggol Cove Primary School, we envision every student to be an educated
child and a contributing citizen, ready to serve and lead. In ln 2017,
the school developed its Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Holistic English
Literacy Programme (HELP), with the intent of organising an educational
experience that both meets needs of the community and fulfils student learning
objectives.</p>

<p>The celebration started with Dr Janil being welcomed by our MOE Kindergarten
children and our pioneer batch of Scouts.
<br>
<br>Thereafter, all students from Kindergarten to Primary 3 presented several
mass song and dance items to mark this joyous occasion, followed by Dr
Janil’s official opening of the school.
<br>
<br>After the rousing performances put up by all our students, they then enjoyed
themselves with a Carnival, short film screening, and Scratch games created
by P3 students.
<br>
<br>We would like to thank our wonderful parent volunteers who helped to look
after the students and supported the teachers in running the activities.
<br>
<br>The many giving hearts and serving hands made this official opening a
memorable experience for all.</p>

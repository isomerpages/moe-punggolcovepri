<p>Greetings and Happy New Year to all!</p>
<p>Our warmest welcome to our 2025 Primary One students, Kindergarten One
students and all new students with their parents and guardians into our
big PCPS family. As we welcome everyone to a brand-new school year, we
look forward to partnering with all our parents and guardians to bring
out the best in our students and realise their fullest potential.</p>
<p>The year 2025 marks a significant milestone for Punggol Cove Primary as
the school celebrates its 10 years of school founding. We are deeply appreciative
of our past school leaders and staff for their valuable contributions to
school-building and growth, and developing in our school community the
EMC (Empathy, Mindfulness, Care) values-driven culture of sharing and caring
for one another.</p>
<p>Building on the strong foundation laid over the last 10 years, the school
embarked on a journey in 2024 to envision the future of learning and teaching
in PCPS to prepare our students for the volatile, uncertain and complex
world. Our staff and students came together to have conversations on our
aspirations for the distinctive future-ready PCPS students and re-imagine
what and how will the students learn to equip them with the dispositions
and emerging 21st century competencies to be future ready.</p>
<p>As we mark our 10th Anniversary in 2025, the school is proud to launch
its refreshed vision together with the learning goals and dispositions,
which espoused our collective aspirations for our PCPS students. Our new
school vision is `<strong>Every PCPS student, a Curious Lifelong Learner, a Confident Leader and a Responsible Innovator</strong>’
who possesses the COR3 learning dispositions of <strong>Curiosity, Open-Mindedness, Reflectiveness, Resilience and Responsibility</strong>.</p>
<p>At the end of 6 years, we aspire to develop in each of our PCPS graduands,</p>
<p>the Curious Lifelong Learner who is</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>eager to learn, discover and question to deepen understanding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflective and able to improve thoughts, attitudes, behaviours and actions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resilient in his/her pursuit of goals and sees failures as opportunities
for growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>discerning in distilling and critically assessing information both online
and offline</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the Confident Leader who is</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>anchored on school and R3ICH (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity,
Care, Harmony) values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>open to perspectives, respectful and clear when communicating with others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>able to collaborate, leverage others' strengths, and rally others towards
shared goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>courageous in unfamiliar situations and take risks responsibly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the Responsible Innovator who is</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>concerned about local and global issues, while maintaining a sense of
rootedness to Singapore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>open-minded, creative and imaginative to consider different possibilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>able to create solutions which serve the needs of others, the environment,
school and community</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To realise our desired student outcomes, the school is guided by its 3
refreshed Strategic Thrusts to <strong>nurture the whole child who is Curious, Confident and Responsible; develop a collaborative and competent staff who cares and serves with empathy; and foster quality partnerships with our parents and partners to enhance student learning experiences.</strong>
</p>
<p>We look forward to the continued support from our parents, stakeholders
and partners as we actualise the future of learning in PCPS to equip our
students with the knowledge, skills, EMC values and COR3 learning dispositions
so that they are able to thrive and harness opportunities in the rapidly
changing world.</p>
<p>We are grateful to our School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group,
parents and partners for their belief and trust in the school leadership
and for working in collaboration with our staff to enrich our students’
learning experiences and broaden their horizons. We appreciate their unyielding
support for our school directions and programmes.</p>
<p>Here is wishing one and all a purposeful and remarkable year in 2025 as
we come together to celebrate 10 inspiring years of school growth and chart
the way forward as we lead the school into its next decade.</p>
<p>Yours in Learning,</p>
<p>Mrs Teo Whye Choo</p>
<p>Principal</p>

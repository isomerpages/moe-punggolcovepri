<h4>Dear Parents/Guardians and Partners,</h4><h4>Happy New Year to all!</h4><h4>A warm welcome to our 2024 Primary One students, Kindergarten One students and all new students as well as their parents and guardians to our big PCPS family. We look forward to building strong home-school partnership with you as your child begins his/her learning adventure in PCPS. </h4><h4>In Punggol Cove Primary, we believe that `Every Child is a Gift, is Gifted and is a Gift to the Community’.&nbsp; We are committed to value this `Gift’ that you have entrusted upon us and to discover and polish the gem in your child. We seek to provide an inclusive learning environment where each child develops the intrinsic motivation and confidence to strive and thrive in his/her own unique way.  </h4><h4>We stay true to our mission to nurturing the whole child and growing future-ready PCPS leaders through quality student-centric programmes, competent staff and purposeful partnerships with our parents and partners. Through our mindful school programmes and experiences, we ignite the joy of reading and learning in the students, nurture the unique strengths and talents in every child and develop his dispositions to be a curious learner, adaptive and inventive thinker, confident communicator, an upright and empathetic contributor to the school, community and the world. </h4><h4>Moving into its next phase of development, the school is set to embark on a journey to envision the future of teaching and learning in PCPS to prepare our students for a world full of uncertainties and complexities. While we continue to strengthen the foundation of literacy and numeracy, we are mindful to re-imagine what and how the students learn to equip them with the dispositions, socio-emotional and emerging 21st century competencies to be future-ready.</h4><h4>As facilitators and designers of learning experiences, our teachers continue to deepen their curriculum knowledge, pedagogical and assessment practices. They work in collaboration to plan and enact engaging and authentic lessons, differentiated to meet the needs of our diverse learners. We seek to extend and enrich our student and staff learning beyond the classroom through building sustained partnerships with the community and industries. </h4><h4>We are grateful to our School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, parents and partners for working in close partnership with the school to bring out the best in our students. We appreciate their trust in the school leadership and their unyielding support for the school directions and programmes. We look forward to yet another purposeful year in 2024 as we work together to bring about more exciting possibilities for our students in PCPS. </h4><h4></h4><h4>Yours in Education,</h4><h4>Mrs Teo Whye Choo</h4><h4>Principal</h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:30%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/mrs%20teo.jpg"></div><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><blockquote><h4>The only skill that will be important in the 21st century is the skill of learning new skills.

<p>Dear Parents/Guardians and Partners,</p>
<p>Happy New Year to all!</p>
<p>A warm welcome to our 2024 Primary One students, Kindergarten One students
and all new students as well as their parents and guardians to our big
PCPS family. We look forward to building strong home-school partnership
with you as your child begins his/her learning adventure in PCPS.</p>
<p>In Punggol Cove Primary, we believe that `Every Child is a Gift, is Gifted
and is a Gift to the Community’.&nbsp; We are committed to value this `Gift’
that you have entrusted upon us and to discover and polish the gem in your
child. We seek to provide an inclusive learning environment where each
child develops the intrinsic motivation and confidence to strive and thrive
in his/her own unique way.</p>
<p>We stay true to our mission to nurturing the whole child and growing future-ready
PCPS leaders through quality student-centric programmes, competent staff
and purposeful partnerships with our parents and partners. Through our
mindful school programmes and experiences, we ignite the joy of reading
and learning in the students, nurture the unique strengths and talents
in every child and develop his dispositions to be a curious learner, adaptive
and inventive thinker, confident communicator, an upright and empathetic
contributor to the school, community and the world.</p>
<p>Moving into its next phase of development, the school is set to embark
on a journey to envision the future of teaching and learning in PCPS to
prepare our students for a world full of uncertainties and complexities.
While we continue to strengthen the foundation of literacy and numeracy,
we are mindful to re-imagine what and how the students learn to equip them
with the dispositions, socio-emotional and emerging 21st century competencies
to be future-ready.</p>
<p>As facilitators and designers of learning experiences, our teachers continue
to deepen their curriculum knowledge, pedagogical and assessment practices.
They work in collaboration to plan and enact engaging and authentic lessons,
differentiated to meet the needs of our diverse learners. We seek to extend
and enrich our student and staff learning beyond the classroom through
building sustained partnerships with the community and industries.</p>
<p>We are grateful to our School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group,
parents and partners for working in close partnership with the school to
bring out the best in our students. We appreciate their trust in the school
leadership and their unyielding support for the school directions and programmes.
We look forward to yet another purposeful year in 2024 as we work together
to bring about more exciting possibilities for our students in PCPS.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yours in Education,
<br>Mrs Teo Whye Choo
<br>Principal</p>

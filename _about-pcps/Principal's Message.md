<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>Greetings and Happy New Year to all!</p>
<p>We warmly welcome our Primary One students, Kindergarten One students,
and all new students and their families to our big PCPS family. Beginning
a new school journey is both exciting and filled with anticipation, and
we are delighted to walk alongside you as your child takes these important
first steps in learning, growth, and discovery.</p>
<p>At the heart of PCPS is our belief that <strong>every child is a gift, is gifted, and is a gift to the community</strong>.
We see each child as unique, capable, and full of potential. Guided by
this belief, we are committed to nurturing the whole child—academically,
socially, morally and emotionally—so that every learner experiences success,
develops confidence, and grows with purpose.</p>
<p>We believe that every child can learn, wants to learn, and can achieve.
When learners experience success, they build the confidence to try, to
persevere, and to grow. We aim to develop critical thinkers, effective
communicators, and collaborative learners who are guided by our strong
EMC values of <strong>Empathy, Mindfulness, and Care</strong>, as well as
the COR³ learning dispositions of <strong>Curiosity, Open-Mindedness, Reflectiveness, Resilience, and Responsibility,</strong> to
learn for life.</p>
<p>Our school vision, <strong>“Every PCPS student, a Curious Lifelong Learner, a Confident Leader and a Responsible Innovator,”</strong> reflects
our aspiration for every child who passes through our gates. Anchored by
our mission of <strong>Nurturing the Whole Child, Growing Future Leaders</strong>,
we seek to ignite curiosity, develop character, and empower our students
to take ownership of their learning and actions, in school and beyond,
for the good of the wider community.</p>
<p>Teaching and learning at PCPS is guided by our Teaching and Learning Framework,
which informs the design of meaningful learning experiences across the
total curriculum. Grounded in the principles of autonomy, competence, and
relatedness, the framework addresses students’ motivational needs and supports
them in becoming engaged and self-directed learners. Through school-wide
pedagogies such as strategic questioning, metacognition, and ongoing assessment
for flexible grouping, our teachers design enabling and empowering learning
experiences where learning is purposeful, reflective, and adaptive.</p>
<p>Central to this journey is our partnership with parents and stakeholders.
We deeply value strong home–school partnerships built on mutual respect,
trust, and a shared belief in our students’ potential. Your unwavering
support, encouragement, and collaboration strengthen our efforts to bring
out the best in every child and realise his fullest potential.</p>
<p>We look forward to a meaningful and rewarding journey together as we continue
to grow, learn, and shape the future of our students - one child at a time.</p>
<p><em>Yours in Learning,</em>
<br>Mrs Teo Whye Choo
<br>Principal</p>

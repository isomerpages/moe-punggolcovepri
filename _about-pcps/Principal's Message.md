<p style="font-size:20px"><b> Dear Parents/Guardians and Partners,</b> </p>

<p style="font-size:20px"><b>Greetings and Happy New Year to all!</b></p>
 
<p style="font-size:20px"><b>The year 2023 marks the new phase of growth for Punggol Cove Primary School with the change of school leadership. As I assume leadership of the school as its second Principal, I am appreciative of the pioneering work by my predecessor who had fostered a caring and empowering school culture and readied the school for the next stage of its development. It is my privilege to be given the opportunity to serve and contribute to our big family at Punggol Cove Primary and MK@Punggol Cove and build upon the good work done. Together with my staff and in collaboration with parents and stakeholders, we will bring out the best in every PCPS student.</b></p>

<p style="font-size:20px"><b> In Punggol Cove, we believe that \`Every Child is a Gift, is Gifted and is a Gift to the Community’.&nbsp; We are committed to value each \`Gift’ who has been entrusted upon us by our parents and to discover the gem in each of them. It is our mission to provide an inclusive learning environment where each child develops the confidence and dispositions to strive and thrive in his/her own rights. Through our mindful school programmes and experiences, we seek to ignite the joy of learning in the students, nurture the unique strengths and talents in every child and develop his/her potential to be a curious learner, critical thinker, an upright and empathetic contributor to the community.</b></p>
 
<p style="font-size:20px"><b> Braving the pandemic over the last 3 years, we are grateful to our staff who have been adaptable, open-minded and resilient in the face of uncertainties and stood together to ensure that learning continued and kept the school safe for all. Moving forward to live with Covid-19, we look forward to resume normalcy in our school programmes and learning experiences which are critical to the social development and mental wellness of our students. &nbsp;To meet the diverse needs of our students, our teachers continually upskill to enhance their subject mastery and pedagogical skills to design purposeful learning experiences that are authentic and relevant for our learners. We embrace partnerships with community and industry to extend the learning of our students and staff to broaden their horizons and perspectives</b></p>

<p style="font-size:20px"><b> We thank our School Advisory Committee, parents and partners for their understanding and support as they journeyed alongside the school since its inception. We look forward to their continued support and feedback as we work together as One PCPS to realise our desired outcomes to nurture the whole child and grow the future leader in every PCPS student.</b></p>
 
<p style="font-size:20px"><b> We wish one and all a Healthy, Engaging and Purposeful 2023!</b></p>
 
<p style="font-size:20px"><b> Yours in Education,</b></p>

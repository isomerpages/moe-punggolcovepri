*   The strategic framework provides direction for the school in the design and delivery of its programmes and processes. The framework is centred on the school’s core values of empathy, mindfulness and care and our beliefs that every student is a gift, gifted and a gift to the community. 
*   The school’s effort in curriculum planning and design are based on the 3rd ring of the diagram, namely the 4P framework which encompasses Purposeful Learning (PL) ,Purposeful Being (PB) Purposeful Teaching and Self-Care (PTSC) and Purposeful Engagement (PE).   
      
    
*   The enactment of the school’s curriculum and processes is guided by the school’s vision – Every child an educated child and contributing citizen, ready to serve and to lead and further emphasized by our school motto –To Serve and To Lead.

<p>The school strategic framework provides direction for the school in the
design and delivery of its programmes and processes. The framework is centred
on the school’s core values of empathy, mindfulness and care and our beliefs
that every child a gift, is gifted and a gift to the community.</p>
<p>The school’s effort in curriculum planning and design are based on the
3rd ring of the diagram, namely the 4P framework which encompasses Purposeful
Learning, Purposeful Being, Purposeful Teaching &amp; Work; Self-Care and
Purposeful Engagement.</p>
<p>The enactment of the school’s curriculum and processes is guided by the
school’s vision – Every PCPS student, a Curious Lifelong Learner, a Confident
Leader and a Responsible Innovator, and mission – Nurturing the whole child,
growing future leaders. These are encapsulated in our school motto – To
Serve and To Lead.</p>

As Punggol Cove Primary School sets sail towards a new horizon, seeking adventures and challenges, the school strives to provide a Safe Haven amidst a fast-changing environment for all students to play, learn and grow.  The green sails represent **Uprightness in Character** and the blue base of the yacht represents **Stable and Strong Values** that the school will be anchored upon.

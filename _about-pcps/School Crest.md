<p>As Punggol Cove Primary School sets sail towards a new horizon, seeking
adventures and challenges, the school strives to provide a Safe Haven amidst
a fast-changing environment for all students to play, learn and grow. &nbsp;The
green sails&nbsp;represent&nbsp;<strong>Uprightness in Character</strong>&nbsp;and
the blue base of the yacht represents&nbsp;<strong>Stable and Strong Values</strong>&nbsp;that
the school will be anchored upon.</p>

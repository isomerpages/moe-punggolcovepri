On this day, our first batch of pupils and parents attended the P1 Orientation Day with great enthusiasm. Many parents were excited to know how a primary school life is like for their children. Parents were also briefed on how they could better prepare their children for the first day of school. Besides, during the orientation, pupils were also introduced to their class Form teachers and that was a good starting point where rapport and positive relationship were formed.

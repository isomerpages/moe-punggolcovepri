At the start of the academic year, pupils went through a three _days P1 Transition Programme_ to prepare them for their primary school life. During these three days, pupils were equipped with fundamental skills like packing their own school bags and the proper way of washing their hands. Pupils also participated in fun-filled activities like the Mass dance in the Multi-Purpose hall. At the end of the programme, pupils have built a stronger rapport with their teachers and classmates.

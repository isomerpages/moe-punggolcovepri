On this day, we welcome our second batch of pupils and parents in Punggol Cove Primary School. Many were looking forward to the P1 Orientation Day with great anticipation. 

  

Strong and positive relationship were fostered between the pupils and their Form Teachers during the classroom interaction time. It was heartening to know that many had enjoyed themselves and were ready to embark a new journey with their new friends and teachers.

It was a day to celebrate with our very first batch of pupils in completing their first year in PCPS! It was their first time putting up a performance as a class with Beatboxing. Our Malay pupils even put up a song-and-dance item! The rest of the day saw pupils going through team-building games, seed planting and watching a photo montage to reminisce the wonderful experiences they have gone through this year. The pupils ended the day by cleaning up their own classrooms with Use-Your-Hands campaign.

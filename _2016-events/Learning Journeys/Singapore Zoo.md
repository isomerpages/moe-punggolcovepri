The visit to the Singapore zoo acted as an effective and engaging educational tool for our pupils as they learnt to appreciate nature and promote wildlife conservation. The learning was further enhanced in the classroom as our teachers designed and administered focused activities on the wildlife theme. These activities were connected to the academic curriculum.
